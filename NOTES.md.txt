Hi;
I understand problem like this and also solutions: 
Products came seperate from Stedger platform. I merge this data has one attribute . 
And Stedger platform have many products so Output is must be object like examples. 
I combined to product and after push to output variable.


Yes, I'm redoing a test. I visualized this scenario with express. please do npm to get modules.
You can use scripts in package json to run it. 
When you run npm run dev, stedger api is running on localhost:3000. 
There are two pages product list and product detail. 
There is also a service that gives the products in the products link. 
Also, the gesture package has been added to test the function. I'm waiting for your answer .
